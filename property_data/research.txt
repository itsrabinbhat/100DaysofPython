--> website for property data https://appbrewery.github.io/Zillow-Clone/

--> BeautifulSoup Requirements
    1. Use BeautifulSoup/Requests to scrape all the listings from the Zillow-Clone web address.

    2. Create a list of links for all the listings you scraped.

    3. Create a list of prices for all the listings you scraped.
        Clean up the strings, by removing any "+" symbols and other information so that you are only left with a dollar price. The price should look like "$1,234" instead of "$1,234+ /mo"

    4. Create a list of addresses for all the listings.
        Clean up the address data as well. Remove any newlines, pipe symbols |, and unnecessary whitespace.

--> Selenium Requirements  
    Use Selenium to fill in the form you created. Each listing should have its price/address/link added to the form. You will need to fill in a new form for each new listing.
